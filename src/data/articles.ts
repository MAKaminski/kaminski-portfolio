      'A practical guide for fintech founders deciding between fractional CFO and CTO help — the signals that tell you which seat is actually on fire, and how to sequence the two.',
    date: '2026-07-20',

<p>Almost every early fintech founder I talk to asks a version of the same question: do I need a
finance leader or a technical leader next? For most companies the honest answer is "both, eventually"
— but you rarely have the budget or the org for both at once. So the real question is sequencing.</p>

<h2>Start with the seat that's actually on fire</h2>
<p>Ignore titles for a minute and look at where the risk is compounding. A fractional <strong>CFO</strong>
earns their keep first when you're raising, when a lender or sponsor is about to diligence you, when
your unit economics are murky, or when revenue recognition and compliance (ASC 606, SOC 2, PCI, state
lending rules) are becoming board-level questions. A fractional <strong>CTO</strong> earns their keep
first when architecture decisions are being made that you'll live with for years, when velocity has
stalled, when security/reliability incidents are appearing, or when you're hiring engineers faster than
anyone is steering them.</p>

<h2>Fintech blurs the line more than most industries</h2>
<p>Here's the wrinkle unique to fintech: the finance and the engineering are the same system. Your
ledger <em>is</em> your product. A "finance" decision about how you recognize interest income or reserve
for credit losses is also a data-model decision your engineers have to implement correctly. That's why
in fintech the worst outcome is a CFO and a CTO who can't speak each other's language — you get a
beautiful model that the platform can't produce, or a fast platform that can't survive an audit.</p>

<h2>A simple sequencing framework</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-product / pre-revenue:</strong> usually technical first. Get the architecture and the
data model right; a fractional CFO can wait until there are real numbers to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Raising or lending imminent:</strong> finance first. You need clean models, a defensible
cap table, and diligence-ready books before money is on the line.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling with real revenue:</strong> whichever function is the current bottleneck — but bias
toward the one that reduces existential risk (compliance, security, runway) over the one that adds
convenience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The case for one operator who does both, part-time</h2>
<p>For companies at the $0–100MM revenue stage, the cleanest answer is often a single fractional operator
who is bilingual — someone who can build the financial model a sponsor expects <em>and</em> read the code
that produces the numbers. It removes the translation layer, it's cheaper than two hires, and it forces
finance and engineering to stay coherent. That's the intersection I work in.</p>

    title: 'Quality of Earnings, Explained for Fintech Founders',
    description:
      'What a Quality of Earnings (QoE) analysis actually looks at, why fintech QoE is different, and how founders can be ready before a buyer or lender runs one.',
    date: '2026-07-18',
    readMinutes: 7,
    body: `
<p>If you're heading toward a raise, a sale, or a credit facility, someone is going to run a Quality of
Earnings analysis on your business. Founders often hear "QoE" and picture a normal audit. It isn't. An
audit asks "are these numbers correct?" A QoE asks a sharper question: <strong>"how much of this
profit is real, repeatable, and transferable?"</strong></p>

<h2>What a QoE actually digs into</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue quality:</strong> Is it recurring or one-time? Concentrated in a few customers?
Recognized correctly under ASC 606? For a lender, is the interest income durable or juiced by a vintage
that hasn't seasoned yet?</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA adjustments:</strong> Which "add-backs" are legitimate (truly one-time) and which are
a founder trying to flatter the number? This is where most of the negotiation happens.</li>
<li><strong>Working capital:</strong> What's the normal level needed to run the business, so the buyer
isn't surprised post-close?</li>
<li><strong>Run-rate vs. reported:</strong> What does the business earn <em>going forward</em>, not what
it happened to report last year?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why fintech QoE is its own animal</h2>
<p>In fintech, the "earnings" question collides with credit and accounting judgment. Loss reserves
(ASC 326 / CECL), the treatment of loan origination fees, how you account for a servicing asset, and the
seasoning of a loan book all move EBITDA materially — and they're all judgment calls a diligence team
will stress-test. A vintage of loans that looks profitable at month three can look very different at
month eighteen. If your data model can't slice performance by vintage, cohort, and product, you'll be
answering these questions manually under time pressure, and that erodes buyer confidence fast.</p>

<h2>How to be QoE-ready before anyone asks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep a clean, monthly-close discipline with a documented revenue-recognition policy.</li>
<li>Maintain a defensible reserve methodology you can walk through, not just a plug.</li>
<li>Instrument your platform so cohort/vintage performance is a query, not a fire drill.</li>
<li>Pre-build your own "adjusted EBITDA" bridge — know your add-backs and be able to defend each one.</li>
<li>Reconcile your product/ledger data to your financials <em>continuously</em>, not at year-end.</li>
</ul>

<p>The founders who sail through QoE are the ones whose finance and engineering were built together, so
the numbers a diligence team asks for already exist in the system. If you want a pre-diligence read on
where your story is strong and where it's thin, <a href="https://calendly.com/kaminski1337/15min">let's

    title: "Why Your Fintech's CFO Should Be Able to Read the Codebase",
    description:
      "In fintech the ledger is the product. A finance leader who can read the code that produces the numbers removes the most expensive translation layer in the company.",
    date: '2026-07-15',
    readMinutes: 5,
    body: `
<p>In most industries, finance and engineering can operate as separate worlds connected by a monthly
data export. In fintech, that separation is a liability — because the thing engineering builds and the
thing finance reports on are <em>the same object</em>. Your ledger is your product.</p>

<h2>The translation tax</h2>
<p>When a CFO can't read the system, every finance question becomes a ticket. "Why did net interest
income drop 4%?" becomes a week of back-and-forth: finance describes what they see, engineering guesses
at the cause, an analyst runs a one-off query, and the answer arrives after the moment to act has
passed. Multiply that across a fast-moving fintech and the translation tax is enormous — not just in
time, but in decisions made blind.</p>

<h2>What changes when the CFO is technical</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, better answers:</strong> the person accountable for the P&amp;L can trace a number to
its source in the data model instead of waiting on someone else.</li>
<li><strong>Correct-by-construction accounting:</strong> revenue recognition, fee amortization, and loss
reserves get implemented right the first time because finance is in the design conversation, not
downstream of it.</li>
<li><strong>Credible diligence:</strong> when a buyer or regulator asks how a number is produced, the
answer is precise, not hand-wavy.</li>
<li><strong>Cheaper org:</strong> you need fewer heroic analysts stitching finance and product together
by hand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>This isn't about the CFO writing production code</h2>
<p>It's about fluency. A finance leader doesn't need to ship features — they need to read a schema,
follow a query, understand how the platform books an event, and hold a real conversation with engineers
about trade-offs. That fluency is rare, and in fintech it's worth a premium, because it collapses the
most expensive gap in the company.</p>

<p>I built my career at exactly this intersection — PE-grade finance and hands-on engineering. If that's
the gap in your team, <a href="https://calendly.com/kaminski1337/15min">let's talk</a>.</p>
